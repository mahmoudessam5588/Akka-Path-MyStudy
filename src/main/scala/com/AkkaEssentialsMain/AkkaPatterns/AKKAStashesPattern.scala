//Stashes Pattern Let As Put Actor Aside For Later as they can't or they shouldn't process at this
//moment of exact time
//when the time is right prepend them to the mailbox to process them by context.become()
object AKKAStashesPattern extends App {
  //General Concept
  //resources are block for actor
  //if resourceActor Opened
  // - it receives read / write request to the resources
  //- otherwise it will postpone all read/write request until the state is open
  //-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  //PseudoCode:
  //ResourceActor
  //   -open => it can receive read/write request to the resources
  //   -otherwise it will  postpone all read/write request until state is open
  //ResourceActor is closed
  //  -open=> Switch to open state
  //   -read /write Messages is POSTPONED
  //resourceActor is open
  //      -read/write are handled
  //        -close => switch to closed state
  //-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  //Applying Different Scenarios:
  //[Open,Read ,Read,Write]
  //-switch to open state
  //-read the data
  //-read the data again
  //-write the data
  //[Read,Open,Write]
  //read and write POSTPONED so we will put them in {{{stash: [Read]}}}
  //open=>switch to open state
  //Mailbox: [Read,Write]
  //read and write are handled

  case object Open
  case object Close
  case object Read

  //Step One Mixin Stash Trait

      case Open =>
        log.info("Opening Resource")
        //Step 3 un-stashAll when you switch the msg handler
        unstashAll() //prepending all messages to normal mailbox
        context.become(opened)
      case msg =>
        log.info(s"Stashing $msg Postponed till Resource Is Opened")
        //Step 2 Stash Message U can't Handled
        stash()
